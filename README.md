# [Build a Git-Powered CMS With ASP.NET][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Content management systems generally rely on relational database systems. And rightfully so! Databases excel at storing and retrieving data. However, content management systems have a lot in common with another kind of data store: a source version control repository such as Git. Content management systems need to track similar content and have the same needs for tracking access, authorship and revisions. 

What if we used Git instead of a database for a content management system? In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will lead you through an exploration of this novel use for a Git repository. By following along, you'll build a CMS website that uses GitHub as a back-end and on the way, you'll learn a lot about Git webhooks and ASP.NET version 5.
